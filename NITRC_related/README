# "User_manage" compares the private and public NiTRC list, print out the ones in the public but not in the private, then need to add them in manually.

User lists were copied from the main "admin" page of both projects into txt files, then some characters (list Users, line change, space) are removed by replace.

## Last Checked dates: 10/19/2020, all up to date.
